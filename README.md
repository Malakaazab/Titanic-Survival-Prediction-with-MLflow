# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction with MLflow Tracking

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning models and to track experiments using **MLflow**.

## 📊 Project Overview
- Dataset: [Titanic Dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
- Goal: Build and evaluate a classification model that predicts whether a passenger survived.
- Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, MLflow

## ⚙️ Main Steps
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Handling missing values
3. Feature encoding (OneHotEncoder, LabelEncoder)
4. Model training and evaluation
5. Experiment tracking with MLflow

## 🧠 Model Used
- Random Forest Classifier (tuned for better accuracy)

## 📈 Performance
| Metric | Score |
|---------|--------|
| Accuracy | 0.79 |
| Precision | 0.69 |
| Recall | 0.83 |
| F1-score | 0.75 |

## 🧾 MLflow Tracking
MLflow was used to log parameters, metrics, and model artifacts.  
A new experiment named **"Malak Experiment"** was successfully created and tracked.
